Run around the school and answer computer science questions. But beware... you're not alone.
Once you collect all twelve, escape through one of the school's exits.

Tips:
- As Mr. Giblin, you can't enter the girls' toilets. Perhaps the same logic extends to your pursuer?
- For every question you get wrong, she angers
- Any issues or suggestions, message @sosigatbreak
